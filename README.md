üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Philosophy
This project was built using a modern, efficient, and scalable technology stack. The choices were made to ensure a high-quality development experience and an optimized final product.

Framework: React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and manageable UI elements.

Build Tool: Vite provides a lightning-fast development server and an optimized build process, significantly speeding up development and deployment.

Styling: CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS (Adjust as needed) were used to create a maintainable and scalable styling system, ensuring a consistent design language throughout the application.

Deployment: The site is deployed on Netlify, leveraging its continuous deployment features for seamless updates directly from the Git repository.
