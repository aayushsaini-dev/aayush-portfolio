ðŸ“– Project Overview
This portfolio was built from the ground up to be more than just a resumeâ€”it's a digital representation of my identity as a developer. The design philosophy centers around a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of automotive-inspired drama, like the carbon fiber textures. The user experience is enhanced with smooth scrolling and subtle, meaningful animations that guide the user through my story, skills, and projects.

The entire website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
